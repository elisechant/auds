# Statement of Intent 

> This document is to capture the things _we know_ about what we are trying to achieve for AuDS 2.

## Origin 

This is a reset fork of the Australian Government Design System, created from [this commit](https://github.com/govau/design-system-components/commit/0c339a8e2d0c0d7460683279f3b088a8d8a00854).

There is no `govau` remote, and we do not intend to merge back.

## What outcome are we seeking? 

> **ðŸ”µ** Listed are statements that we (?)have consensus on. These ideas can help us shape the _outcomes_ we are trying to achieve.    

* Platform agnostic (HTML, CSS, JS) system 
* To be used as a base for a React Component library
* To maintain what is good about AuDS 
* A modern AuDS
* Maintain the prescriptive styling of AuDS
* Maintain the successful accessibility aspects of AuDS
* Design tokens can be easily extracted 
* To "carry the beacon" of AuDS, and potentially provide an upgrade path to 75+ existing external Govt sites using AuDS
* Future-proof
* Simple and accessible code
* Emphasis on being easy to be used by other Govt and public consumers
* Remove pancake

## Things we are unsure about 

* Whether we want to use Web Components as the JS (+ HTML) layer
* Consolidate exports to a single export instead of multi-package export
* A separate system to a React Component library (AWE Design System)

## Things we don't know

* How to rebrand? inc "AuDS 2"
* What npm scope to push to?
* Whether to build in the open? ie make the repo public
